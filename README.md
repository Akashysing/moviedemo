# movieapplication

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

You can directly run the flutter run command. Please ensure that the simulator or emulator is open. Alternatively, if you have the ID of the emulator or simulator, you can target a specific device by running:

flutter run -d 316AD691-DC6D-4B04-BF3E-31399BA80C4F

In this project, we have implemented GetX state management in Flutter, which provides a more efficient and developer friendly approach compared to other state management solutions such as Provider, Bloc, or Redux. GetX offers a powerful combination of state management, dependency injection, and route management with minimal boilerplate code. In our project, we follow the CLEAN architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and testability. The code is organized into separate layers to decouple the business logic, UI, and data management.

1. Data models
* The JSON data models are stored inside the data/models folder. For instance, we have created a movie_data.dart file which contains the MovieData class. This model is used across different APIs, so it's kept separate from specific modules. By doing this, we ensure that the data models can be reused in future APIs without modifying the module-specific code.
2. Modules
The modules are structured based on features, and for now, we have two primary modules:
1. Movie Dashboard Module
2. Movie Details Module

Each module contains the following sub-folders:
1. Bindings
* The Bindings folder is responsible for connecting the UI to the controller using GetX’s dependency injection. This ensures that the controller is created when the view is loaded and disposed of when the view is removed.
2. Controllers
* The Controller handles the business logic and responds to user actions (like button presses). We use it to manage API calls, navigation logic, and state changes.
* The API calls use callbacks for success (onSuccess) and failure (onFailed) to ensure proper error handling and a clean separation of concerns.
* 
3. Views
* The View folder contains the UI code, which includes both StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget. We have used various Flutter widgets like Visibility, Text, AppBar, ListView.builder, etc., to present the movie data and other information.
4. Routes
* The Routes folder manages the navigation throughout the app. We use GetX’s routing system, which is simple and powerful, to define routes between pages.
5. Services
* The Services folder is where we handle the API calls using GetConnect, which is an HTTP client provided by GetX. It helps in making asynchronous network requests and can be used globally across the app.
6. Constants
* The Constants folder contains constants files such as, including the AppImages, APIEndPoints files. AppStrings file. where all the hardcoded strings are stored to ensure the code is maintainable and free from hardcoded values in the widgets. Same as images and api endpoints 
7. Shared
* Shared folder contains reusable components like custom buttons or card views, ensuring that repetitive UI elements can be reused throughout the app.
8. Enums
* This folder contains the app-specific enums that help in maintaining clean code, such as status codes, API states, or different types of media.

We have organized the assets by adding an images folder within the assets directory. This structure allows flexibility for future implementation, such as adding fonts or local JSON files, by simply creating corresponding fonts or local_json folders. Additionally, I have added the necessary permissions to the Android Manifest file and the Info.plist for iOS. I’ve also updated the app name as required.

I have implemented API services using GetX's GetConnect for efficient network communication. This simplifies handling HTTP requests and responses within the project. With GetConnect, I’ve structured the service layer to manage API calls seamlessly, supporting features like request timeout, interceptors, and automatic JSON decoding. Additionally, I’ve incorporated error handling to manage exceptions gracefully.

This approach allows us to keep the code clean and maintainable, adhering to GetX’s reactive and service-driven architecture. By centralizing the API logic in a service class, the app becomes more modular and easier to scale.

We are implementing getters to display the date, recommendations, and cast, and we’ve incorporated null handling logic in the data model to ensure that everyone can utilize these features wherever needed. Additionally, we are showing a progress indicator and using a shimmer effect in the ListView, along with visibility widgets for cases where data is unavailable. We have also implemented hero animations.
In my current project, which includes flavor management, I am applying the same principles and dedicating my full effort to complete the work. I look forward to discussing this further and refining the structure with your suggestions.
Please review this.
Thank you, sir.
